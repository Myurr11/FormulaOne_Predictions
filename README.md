# 🏎️ F1 Predictions 2025 - Machine Learning Model

## 🚧 Project Status: Under Development
**This project is a work in progress and is primarily intended as a learning exercise in machine learning and data science.**

- The first prediction programs are not expected to be highly accurate.
- The model is being built and improved incrementally, with new features and enhancements added after each race.
- As the project evolves, prediction accuracy will improve as more data and advanced techniques are incorporated.
- This is a learn-by-doing project, so experimentation and ongoing changes are expected.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains machine learning models predicting Formula 1 race outcomes using:
- Historical race data from FastF1 API
- Gradient Boosting algorithms
- Weather data integration
- Team/driver performance metrics

## 📂 Repository Structure
- For every race the end of the file will be numbered in correlation to the race on the calendar, ex. prediction1 - Australia, prediction2 - China, etc.

## 🔧 Usage
Run the prediction script:
```bash
python3 prediction1.py
```
Expected output:
```
🏁 Predicted 2025 Australian GP Winner 🏁
Driver: Charles Leclerc, Predicted Race Time: 82.67s
...
🔍 Model Error (MAE): 3.22 seconds
```

## 📈 Model Performance
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used to evaluate how well the model predicts race times. Lower MAE values indicate more accurate predictions.
